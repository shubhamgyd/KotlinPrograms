/*
Nullability is the programming concept where a variable has an absence of any value.
In Kotlin you can use null to indicate that a variable has no value.

In this exercise, you will practice how to handle nullable values and avoid NPE or
null pointer exceptions

To accomplish this, there are a few different approaches that can be taken such as;
check for null in a condition, use safe calls, the Elvis Operator or the assertion
operator

This exercise concentrates on these two approaches
* Elvis Operator
* Assertion Operator

/**
 * A Map and example usages
 *
 * In this reading, you will learn to create a map using the mapOf function. You will
 * also learn how to find a value in a map by using the 'key' and you'll explore how
 * to add elements to a map. Lastly, you will learn how to iterate over a map.
 *
 * Map
 * Map represents and unordered collection of key-value pairs. Keys are unique and
 * each of them maps to exactly one value. The values can have duplicates. Maps are
 * useful for storing logical connections between objects, for example, an employee's ID
 * and their position.
 *
 * Creating maps
 * You can create a map using the mapOf function and then use key-value pairs as
 * arguments to specify key-value associations. For instance, you might define a
 * map that associates countries with their capitals. Pairs can be defined using a
 * constructor or using the to function.
